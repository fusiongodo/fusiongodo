## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m Alex ðŸ‘‹ â€“ a software engineer and (soon) B.Sc. in Applied Computer Science, now also pursuing a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering. I focus on backend development and data science (yes, that sometimes means using Python ðŸ˜’). My projects range from CNN-based object detection and data analytics to REST APIs, e-commerce, and web development.  

ðŸ’» **Languages & Tools:** Java, Kotlin, C#, Python, TypeScript
